**Mental health challenges are a growing concern in today's world.** Mental challenges seem to impact alot of people and a larger amount of thoughs people are entering or have been in the world of video games. This survey was taken by over 13,000 people who have been asked multiple questions involving their mental stability. This project is a deeper look into the reality of video games to see if mental health is a concern in gamers.

### **Motivation**   
Growing up video games have always been apart of my life. I have always been around games and have had many friends online who have and still are suffering with mental health challenges. I am so happy that they haven't lost there battle but sadly there have been many of my favorite content creators that have lost there battle. it doesn't just affect me but also the thousands of other people that watched them. I just want to bring light to who ever is reading this about the challenges that people suffer every day due to mental health and show that there are people out there that do need your help, sometimes they look like they are living your best life but always remember that it could be a mask. Always look for signs because they are always there.

### **Data Questions**  
- Do certain games impact a persons difficulty of life? (Doing their work, Taking care of things at home, Getting along with other people)
- How do people view their personal life, are they satisfied?
- Does employment status affect how much they play? How do they compare?
- Are video games a good hobby for someone to pick up?

### **Known Issues and Challenges**   
- This is my first time using a survey data set. Not used to the way it is formatted
- Not all questionnaires were required so there was a good amount of missing data
- GitHub challenges (Had to redo ReadMe)
- Had to make own scale with 2 of the questionnaires to use them properly in PowerBI
